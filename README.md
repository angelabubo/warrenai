WarrenAI is a fictional web app that lets users sign up and view real-time information about stocks, financial news, manage their portfolio, create their own watchlist. It also provides a "fictional" list of recommended stocks to showcase the display of stock components.

Disclaimer : This project aims to showcase developer's skills in full-stack web development. Stock information and news data are guaranteed real-time as they were generated from free-tier financial APIs. However, "company"-recommended stocks are just fictional for the purpose of page display and presentation.
